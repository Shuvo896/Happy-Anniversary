            <strong style="font-size: 30px; color: #F4C2C2;">Dear Ony,</strong> <br>

            Youâ€™ve probably realized by now just how dumb and clumsy I am.
            I canâ€™t even understand how I manage to mess things up so badly.
            Sending an email of all things to wish you on our anniversary?
            Itâ€™s pathetic, and it just proves I am a loser.
            I might be the worst boyfriend any woman could ever have. 
            I'm sooo, soo sorry that you ended up with someone like me.
            I really wish we could at least see each other today. <br>But "LONG DISTANCE :(". 
            Long dintance with you from what?<br>
            Well everything actually started from class 10 when Araf said, 
            "Mama Ony ekta woman of culture." From that moment, I imagined you in my frame. 
            I sometimes looked at you being 
            very curious, I always wanted to know more about you. 
            A veryy quick girl who moves 25 thousand times in a second (haha). 
            You know what? I wanted to have conversations with you 
            (without thinking that I am a creep). But for idk what reason 
            I never had a chance to talk to you 
            (ki niye kotha bolbo bhai its gonna be creepy and akward if I randomly start talking!!). 
            Koti koti bochorrr por 
            when I saw your account of Facebook I smashed the 'add 
            friend' button. Still I never found a way to approach you. 
            But you almost regularly reacted to my posts. I used to 
            notice them like I would get happy damn she liked this she 
            liked that. Well all these and after that CU exam. Trust 
            mee my eyes locked into you (not in a creepy way). From 
            that I started thinking about you more frequently. Your 
            posts/ your reacts to my post this small interaction 
            used to make me happy. Then the day you got chance at 
            SUST trust me It made me soo happy for you. I thought jodi 
            amio SUST e chance paitam maybe we could have spent some time hanging out. 
            We I didnâ€™t got into SUST but but guess what the universe gave me chance with the 
            water rocket contest. Man first thing came to mind is I will definitely meet you. 
            The day when I arrived at Sylhet I wanted to meet you instantly. 
            I told you to come in to morning so that we could hangout more. 
            But you decided to come afternoon ðŸ˜¡. Finally when 
            you came with a Cute red dress instantly caught my eyes. 
            I was like this 'ðŸ˜®' when I saw you. Being with you and hearing you yapp about eta sheta 
            was really cute. I then thought umm!!! Will she be mine? But I always thought 
            you were out of my league. And this made me sad. Then we slowly
            started talking. Each and every conversation with you 
            always made me happy. Then I slowly started to fall in love with you. 
            I didnâ€™t even know how it was happening. I became more and 
            more comfy with you. The day when you said about the other 
            guy approaching you, my everything collapsed. I felt very 
            excluded, very pushed away and sad. Then I wanted to escalate 
            things asap. I didnâ€™t know how but I wanted to. First I 
            thought when you come back to Dhaka I will tell you 
            everything but It was also a risk that might be late. 
            I needed to do something. Then 29th of January came. 
            I donâ€™t even know how I did that but yeah I had to do it 
            knowing that there is a 1% chance. I had in mind that itâ€™s 
            a do or die. <strong>And before I knew it, that random girl from 9th grade 
            became the most important person in my life who I canâ€™t 
            live without.</strong> And an amazing journey begins. The first holding hands to first 
            car date to all the late night calls I love everything 
            about you. Then the first Sylhet dates. The most 
            beautiful 3 days I have ever had. It was sooo dreamy. 
            I loved the way you look at me. I loved the way you will always 
            hold my left hand. I love how you let me pet you and baby 
            you. I loved holding your soft hand. I wanna hold your cold 
            hand and make it warm always. Your voice heals me. 
            You are a truly perfect human beingâ€”kind, thoughtful, and 
            genuinely good at heart. I really really am 
            lucky to have you in my life. 
            You are always in my mind. Whatever I do I only 
            think about you. You run around my head always. I know 
            I am the worst boyfriend ever. But know that I always love 
            you more than anything. No matter how much I say I love you 
            it is always less. And I do understand you a lot. I just 
            keep messing things up (I am sorryyyyy). I am trying to do better. 
            I sometimes make 
            you mad Umm no all the time actually but know that I love 
            you with all my everything. I will keep doing that even if 
            I die. We have to go a long way. As we have to go long long way there will be 
            complications. But I want you to keep trusting me and 
            believe me whatever I do. I will do everything to make 
            sure you are safe and our relationship is strong. We will fight everything 
            together. 
            Tons of love for you my beautiful wifey. I love everything you do 
            for me sweetheart. Every single details about you makes me more than happy. 
            Donâ€™t ever change. And promise me that you will always be with me 
            no matter what.
