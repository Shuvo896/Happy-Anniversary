            "Dear Ony, <br><br>

            You should know by the time how dumb and clumsy I am. 
            I really don't know how I manage to blunder. 
            I know this is the least to send your partner a gmail 
            just to wish her for the anniversary. This proves that 
            I'm the worst boyfriend a woman can get. I'm sooo soo 
            sorry for you that you got someone like me. I wish we 
            could at least see each other today. Well everything 
            actually started from class 10 when araf said, 
            'Mama Ony ekta woman of culture.' From then I started 
            to take you seriously. I sometimes looked at you being 
            very curious, my heart wanted to know more about you. 
            A veryy quick girl who moves 25 thousand times in a second. 
            After that I wanted to have conversations with you 
            (without thinking that I am a creep). Even though all 
            these I never had a scope to talk to you 
            (ki niye kotha bolbo bhebee!!). Koti koti bochorrr por 
            when I saw your account of Facebook I smashed the add 
            friend button. Still I never found a way to approach you. 
            But you reacted to my posts almost regularly. I used to 
            notice them like I would get happy damn she liked this she 
            liked that. Well all these and after that CU exam. Trust 
            mee my eyes locked into you (not in a creepy way). From 
            that I used to think about you more frequently. Your 
            posts/ your reacts to my post this small interaction 
            used to make me happy. Then the day you got chance at 
            SUST trust me It made me soo happy for you. I thought jodi 
            amio SUST e chance paitam amra ghurte partam. We I didnâ€™t 
            got into SUST but but I was lucky enough to participate 
            in the water rocket contest. I was really waiting for you. 
            I told you to come in to morning so that we could hangout more. 
            But you decided to come afternoon ðŸ˜¡. Finally when 
            you came with a Cute red dress instantly cought my eyes. 
            I was very much ðŸ˜® after seeing you. I was silent the 
            whole day knowing okay she is with me. I always thought 
            you were out of my league. And this made me sad. Then we 
            started talking. Each and every conversation with you 
            always made me happy. Then I slowly fall in love with you. 
            I didnâ€™t even know how it was happening. I became more and 
            more comfy with you. The day when you said about the other 
            guy approaching you, my everything collapsed. I felt very 
            excluded, very pushed away and sad. Then I wanted to escalate 
            things asap. I didnâ€™t know how but I wanted to. First I 
            thought when you come back to Dhaka I will tell you 
            everything but It was also a risk that might be late. 
            I needed to do something. Then 29th of January came. 
            I donâ€™t even know how I did that but yeah I had to do it 
            knowing that there is a 1% chance. I had in mind that itâ€™s 
            a do or die. Ofc I would try if you donâ€™t accept me. And 
            before you know it we are finally together. From then it 
            has been an amazing adventure so far. I know we have to 
            go a long way in our life. The first meeting to first 
            dare date to all the late night calls I love everything 
            about you. You are always in my mind. Whatever I do I only 
            think about you. I know you deserve more than this. I know 
            I am the worst boyfriend ever I know. But know that I love 
            you more than anything. No matter how much I say I love you 
            it is always less. And I do understand you a lot. I just 
            keep messing things up (I am sorryyyyy). I sometimes make 
            you mad Umm no all the time actually but know that I love 
            you with all my everything. I will keep doing that even if 
            I die. As we have to go long long way there will be 
            complications. But I want you to keep trusting me and 
            believe me whatever I do. I will do everything to make 
            sure we are together in the future. We will fight everything 
            together. I will make you my wife I promise babe. 
            Tons of love for you my sweetheart. I love everything you do 
            for me. Every single details about you makes me more than happy. 
            Donâ€™t ever change and promise me that you will be with me 
            no matter what. <br><br>

            HAPPY ANNIVERSARY BABE. <br><br>

            I LOVE YOU A LOTTTTTT <br><br>

            Yours ever, <br>
